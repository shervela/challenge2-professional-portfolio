        <p>
          Born and raised in California, I grew up in San Jose (in Northern
          California) then moved to Los Angeles (in Southern California). I grew
          up loving art and nature and started drawing anything I could think of
          since kindergarten. From dinosaurs to flowers and to cartoon
          characters. I got into intro to design courses in college and realized
          I had an interest in creating layouts while learning InDesign. After a
          few years I changed course and went into Pharmacy as a Pharmacy
          Technician and stayed that course for over 8 years. I later became a
          stay-at-home mom after I suffered from an injury back in 2019.
        </p>

        <p>
          Just at the beginning of 2022 I wanted to make a career change and
          somehow developed an interest in web development after looking back
          into graphic design. I realized I loved the idea of learning how to
          create a webpage and took a few courses on basic coding. I am eager to
          learn and enthusiastic about becoming great at it. I love and admire
          all aspects of design and I can't wait to see how far I can go in this
          journey.
