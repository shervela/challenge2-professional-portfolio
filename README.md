# challenge2-professional-portfolio

## Description:

I have created a professional portfolio that will contain examples of my work. This will help me provide viewable examples to any future clients and employers who wish to see my work. A viewable interactive portfolio provides solution to what kind of work I can produce. I learned how to use flexbox, how to create a navigation semantic, and how to apply pseudo-selectors.

## Installation:

To access my project can be viewed through GitHub (url https://github.com/shervela/challenge2-professional-portfolio). Or you can view my direct website, go to https://shervela.github.io/challenge2-professional-portfolio/ .

## Usage:

Once you are directed to my website, you will see my last name as the Title header along with a navigation directory to the right of my name.
There are a total of 4 directories on the navigation bar:

1.  About Me
2.  Work
3.  Contact Me
4.  Resume

Each directory will navigate you to each section of the page. The "resume" should direct to a new page to view my resume. However, the "resume" directory is still under construction.
